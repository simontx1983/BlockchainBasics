Blockchain Blueprint: A Learning-Based Game Blockchain Blueprint is an engaging and educational game inspired by the popular board game Monopoly, designed to teach players about blockchain technology while having fun.

Gameplay Overview Roll the Dice: Players take turns rolling the dice and moving around the game board.

Property Purchase: When landing on a property, players have the option to buy it at full price or take a risk by answering a blockchain-related question. A correct answer allows them to purchase the property at half price. The wrong answer and the property goes back to the bank.

Currency: The in-game currency is sats, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each player starts with the same amount of sats.

Mining Blocks: Every time a player completes a loop around the board, they mine a block and are rewarded with additional sats.

Board Layout: The game board is designed as an infinity loop, with squares representing different blockchain networks. The starting square, Bitcoin, is the most valuable, followed by Ethereum and other squares based on market cap. Players move along this infinite loop, facing different challenges, opportunities, and educational moments that cycle and evolve as the game progresses.

Multiple Levels: Each level of the game focuses on a different blockchain network theme. For example, Level 1 features a mix of all networks, Level 2 is Cosmos-themed, Level 3 is Solana-themed, and so on. Players can choose which theme they want to play.

Property Tiles: Each level features properties representing chains and DAOs within that network. The properties' values and questions are based on the specific blockchain theme.

Nodes: Once a player has made it around the board and land on a square they already own they can start mining by placing nodes on their property. Each node in only available only if the player lands on a square they own and player may only add one node on each turn. Nodes add wealth to your ranking. Each node has a buy value and you buy the node at full price or answer the question correctly to buy it at half price. If an incorrect answer is given the opportunity to buy a node is forfeited for that turn.

Questions: Questions are based on the theme you are on. "Cosmos theme has cosmos based question"

Cards: There are three types of cards. 1: Event cards, these cards are designed for the player to commit to the event. (Market Fluctuations,Regulatory Changes,Technological Breakthroughs,Collaboration Opportunities) 2: Dao card (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) these cards are decision-making characteristic of DAOs allowing players to change the game mechanics. These cards empower players to propose rule changes, allocate funds, activate smart contracts, and collectively make key decisions. From governance proposals to community bounties, each card offers a unique twist that influences gameplay and encourages strategic thinking.
